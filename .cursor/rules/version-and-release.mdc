# Release Workflow

When you have made any changes to this project:

1. **Bump version** in all of: `manifest.json`, `frontend/package.json`, `README.md`, `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`
2. **Add a release note** entry for the new version in `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`
3. **Commit, push, tag, and create a GitHub release** (do not skip this)

This applies to every edit — bug fixes, features, config changes. No exceptions.
